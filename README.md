# Final-Report - Review a final report

## Overview

In this activity, you will review an example of a final report and answer a series of quiz questions. 

So far, you've learned about the actions involved in the Post-incident Activity phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle. This includes the development of the final report, which is documentation that provides a comprehensive review of an incident. It includes essential details of all events related to the incident and recommendations for future prevention.

## Project Description

You recently joined the security team as a level-one security operation center (SOC) analyst at a mid-sized retail company. Along with its physical store locations, your company also conducts operations in e-commerce, which account for 80% of its sales.

You are spending your first week of training becoming familiar with the company's security processes and procedures. Recently, the company experienced a major security incident involving a data breach of over one million users. Because this was a recent and major security incident, your team is working to prevent incidents like this from happening again. This breach happened before you began working at the company. You have been asked to review the final report.

To gain an understanding of the incident's life cycle, your goals for your review are as follows:

  * **Goal 1:** Identify exactly what happened.
  * **Goal 2:** Identify when it happened.
  * **Goal 3:** Identify the response actions that the company took.
  * **Goal 4:** Identify future recommendations.

Step 2: Answer the questions about the final report:
  * What type of security incident was the organization affected by?
    * The organization was affected by a security incident involving data theft.
  * Which section of the report includes an explanation of the root cause of the incident?
    * The investigation section of the final report includes an explanation of the root cause of the incident, which was a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application.
  * What did the attacker use to exploit the e-commerce web application vulnerability?
    * The attacker used forced browsing to exploit the e-commerce web application vulnerability.
  * What recommendations did the organization implement to prevent future recurrences?
    * As part of its recommendations to prevent future recurrences, the organization implemented access control mechanisms and implemented routine vulnerability scans.
   
## Summary
This lab focused on analyzing a final incident report to gain insights into a past security incident. By reviewing the report, you were able to:
* **Identify the Incident Type:** Determine that the incident involved a data breach affecting over a million users.
* **Understand the Root Cause:** Identify the vulnerability in the e-commerce web application that was exploited by the attacker.
* **Analyze the Attack Vector:** Recognize that the attacker used forced browsing to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Review Response Actions:** Understand the steps taken by the organization to contain the incident and mitigate its impact.
* **Identify Preventive Measures:** Learn about the recommendations implemented to prevent future similar incidents, such as vulnerability scanning and access control mechanisms.

By studying this final report, valuable insights was gained into incident response processes and best practices for preventing future security breaches.
